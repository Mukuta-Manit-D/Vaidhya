You can contact us for all the colab files @ voidex.developer@gmail.com

------------------------------

## Key Features
- Mental Health Prediction and Diagnosis Based on Tests and Felling Analysis.

-------------------------

## Important Notes:
- Each of the endpoint in the flask application is associated with an error code located at the first line of its function definition, which are showed in the Error 500 Page to locate which function is causing the applicarion to fail. The List of Endpoints and corresponding error codes can be located [Here](error_codes.xlsx)
