                  A disease predictor is a computational tool that utilizes data analysis and machine learning to
                  forecast the likelihood of an individual contracting a specific illness. By analyzing symptoms,
                  medical history, and other relevant factors, it assists in early detection and preventive measures,
                  though it's not a replacement for professional diagnosis.

              "When healing from mental illness, early identification and treatment are of vital importance. Based on
              the nature of the illness, there are a range of effective treatments available. For any type of treatment,
              it is essential that the person affected is proactive and fully engaged in their own recovery process.
              Many people with mental illnesses who are diagnosed and treated respond well, although some might
              experience a return of symptoms. Even in such cases, with careful monitoring and management of the
              disorder, it is still quite possible to live a fulfilled and productive life."

              Where you go for help will depend on the nature of the problem and/or symptoms and what best fits you.
              Often, the best place to start is by talking with someone you trust about your concerns, such as a family
              member, friend, clergy, healthcare provider, or other professionals. Having this social support is
              essential in healing from mental illness, and you will be able to ask them for referrals or
              recommendations for trusted mental health practitioners. Search for mental health resources in your area.
              Secondly, there are people and places throughout Nebraska that provide services to talk, to listen, and to
              help you on your journey to recovery. Thirdly, many people find peer support a helpful tool that can aid
              in their recovery. There are a variety of organizations that offer support groups for consumers, their
              family members, and friends. Some support groups are peer led while others may be led by a mental health
              professional.

          <div class="pannel">
            <p data-translate>
              To find a family doctor (general physician), visit the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC to use
              their Find a Physician tool. You can also see a family doctor at a local walk-in clinic, though itâ€™s
              helpful to find a regular doctor if you have ongoing care needs. You can also find a psychiatrist through
              the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC. Be aware that you almost always need a doctorâ€™s referral
              to see a psychiatrist.
              You can find a registered psychologist through the BC Psychological Association and the College of
              Psychologists of BC.
              To find a clinical counsellor, visit the BC Association of Clinical Counsellors.
              For more on the differences between these service providers, see the article The Right Path for You:

              Different kinds of therapy are more effective based on the nature of the mental health condition and/or
              symptoms and the person who has them (for example, children will benefit from a therapist who specializes
              in childrenâ€™s mental health). However, there are several different types of treatment and therapy that
              can help.

            Someone I care about has a brain injury. Where can I find more information?

              A brain injury itself isn't the same as a mental illness, though someone who experiences a brain injury
              may also experience mental health problems. These mental health problems may stem from the injury itself
              or from thoughts around the injury (like feelings of loss, anger, or frustration when quality of life
              changes). In some cases, mental health challenges may not be related to a brain injury at all. The good
              news is that mental health problems are treatable, even if you or someone you care about has experienced a
              brain injury. It may be helpful to find a service provider who is familiar with both brain injuries and
              mental health.
              For more information and support, visit the BC Brain Injury Association. You can also find local and
              regional groups and organizations in BC through the Brain Injury Association of Canada.
